//method syntax

//Methods are similar to functions: we declare them with the fn keyword and a name,
//they can have parameters and a return value, and
// they contain some code thatâ€™s run when the method is called from somewhere else.
// Unlike functions, methods are defined within the context of a struct (or an enum or a trait object
